## [1.15.1] — 2026-05-11

### Offer Letter PDF preview + body fixes

#### Fixed
- **Offer Letter preview was using hardcoded mock body** ([api/preview/pdf/offer-letter/route.ts](src/app/api/preview/pdf/offer-letter/route.ts)) and never passed `terms` / `programExpectations`. Now reads `OFFER_LETTER_BODY`, `BANK_DETAILS`, `PROPOSAL_TERMS`, `PROGRAM_EXPECTATIONS` from `SystemSetting`, resolves merge tags, and renders the appendix pages identically to a real send. Preview now matches reality.
- **Removed yellow 7-day expiry box** from offer letter page 1. The expiry / signoff information now lives in the body text (Commencement & A Note from the Team sections) plus the appendix.
- **Extended `OFFER_LETTER_BODY` to full 2-page content** — added the Commencement & Communication, A Note from the Team, and signoff sections from page 2 of the original source PDF. Body is now 1,876 characters (was 1,216).
- **Email body editor textarea was too thin** in Settings → Emails — bumped minimum height to 420px (was ~176px), with `resize-y` enabled so admins can drag taller.

#### Note
The Programme Expectations PDF appendix already worked in the Fee Letter preview (it reads from DB); the issue was offer-letter-specific.

---

## [1.15.0] — 2026-05-11

### PDFs: rich Offer Letter body + T&C / Programme Expectations appendix

#### Offer Letter PDF
- **Body now uses rich markup** — admin-edited `OFFER_LETTER_BODY` supports `**Headings**`, bullets (`-` / `•`), and numbered lines (`1.`). Renders properly in the PDF.
- **"Your Fee Summary" box removed** from page 1 — fees only appear in the page 2 appendix table.
- **Hardcoded "Programme Expectations" removed** from page 1 — now lives in the Settings-editable Programme Expectations block (see below) and renders in the appendix.
- **Hardcoded "About the Programme" bullets removed** — moved into the body text (via the new `OFFER_LETTER_BODY` default), so admin can edit freely.
- **New Page 3 — Terms & Programme Expectations appendix** — renders T&C and Programme Expectations side-by-side in the same rich-markup style as the body.

#### Fee Letter PDF (proposal)
- **Programme Expectations appendix added** below the existing T&C box. Same content shape as the Offer Letter appendix.

#### Settings → T&C tab — new UX
- **Both blocks now Edit-gated** — read-only by default; admin must click Edit to switch to a textarea + Save / Cancel.
- **New Programme Expectations block** — pre-seeded with default copy on first view; same edit-gate pattern; own changelog (`PROGRAM_EXPECTATIONS_CHANGELOG`).
- T&C block continues to track changes in `PROPOSAL_TERMS_CHANGELOG`.
- Both blocks share a reusable `EditableBlock` component.

#### Data seeded
- `OFFER_LETTER_BODY` — replaced the prior shorter default with the long-form body from the supplied PDF, with `{{studentName}}`, `{{programName}}`, `{{batchYear}}` merge tags. Run via [scratch/seed-pdf-appendix-settings.ts](scratch/seed-pdf-appendix-settings.ts).
- `PROGRAM_EXPECTATIONS` — seeded with the 4 numbered expectations from the supplied PDF.
- `PROGRAM_EXPECTATIONS_CHANGELOG` — initialised to `[]`.

#### Touched callers
All 7 callers of `ProposalDocument` (proposal route, fee-letter route, confirm-enrolment, enroll, welcome-email, fee-structure preview, plus the offer letter route) now fetch + pass `programExpectations`.

---

## [1.14.3] — 2026-05-11

### Settings → Emails — reorganise onboarding section

#### Changed
- Self-onboarding section is now split between **canonical workflow** and **utilities** in [offer-settings.tsx](src/components/settings/offer-settings.tsx):
  - **Self-Onboarding Workflow** (3 cards, in workflow order):
    - **O1** — Enrolment Confirmation (with Onboard Link) — auto on ₹50K paid
    - **O2** — Onboarding Submitted Alert (internal, hardcoded) — auto on submit
    - **O3** — Onboarding Welcome Email — auto on Approve
  - **Onboarding Utilities** (no workflow code):
    - **Resend Onboard Link** — manual button used for recovery (expired tokens) or back-fill (existing students enrolled before self-onboard existed). Not part of the canonical flow.
- This drops the old `O4` code; `O3` now refers to the Welcome Email. The Manual Resend (formerly `O2`) is unnumbered because it's not a workflow step.

#### Rationale
The self-onboard happy path is a 3-step pipeline: link delivered → student submits → admin approves. The Manual Resend only fires off-path (recovery / back-fill), so numbering it as a workflow step was misleading. Restructuring puts it in a utilities box and shrinks the canonical flow to its actual 3 steps.

---

## [1.14.2] — 2026-05-11

### Fix auto-O4 + complete email numbering scheme

#### Fixed
- **`onboardingEmailSentAt` no longer set at enrolment** ([api/students/[id]/confirm-enrolment/route.ts](src/app/api/students/%5Bid%5D/confirm-enrolment/route.ts)). The field was being set when the Enrolment Confirmation (O1) went out, but its purpose is to track the Onboarding Welcome Email (O4). Setting it at enrolment made the v1.14.0 auto-fire-O4-on-approve a silent no-op — every approval since v1.14.0 skipped the email. Now O4 only sets the field when it actually fires.

#### Added
- **Workflow codes on all admissions emails** in [offer-settings.tsx](src/components/settings/offer-settings.tsx):
  - `A1` Offer Email · `A2` Offer Letter PDF body · `A3` Offer Reminder 1 · `A4` Offer Reminder 2 · `A5` Revised Offer
  - `O1`–`O4` unchanged (Enrolment Confirmation · Self-Onboard Link · Submitted Alert · Welcome)
- **Workflow codes on fee reminders** in [reminders-tab.tsx](src/components/settings/reminders-tab.tsx):
  - `R1` 1 Month Before · `R2` 1 Week Before · `R3` On Due Date
- **Fallback banner on admin onboard wizard** ([onboard-wizard.tsx](src/components/students/onboard-wizard.tsx)) — amber notice at the top explaining that the wizard is fallback only; students normally onboard themselves via the self-onboard link in O1.

#### Workflow note
Path B (admin onboard wizard) is no longer the primary flow. The Enrolment Confirmation email (O1) sent at `Confirm Enrolment` time already contains a working self-onboard link, so students should self-onboard whenever possible. The wizard remains available as a fallback for students who can't.

---

## [1.14.1] — 2026-05-11

### Fix: O3 Onboarding Submitted Alert now reaches admins

#### Fixed
- [api/onboard/[token]/route.ts](src/app/api/onboard/%5Btoken%5D/route.ts) was reading O3 recipients from `process.env.ONBOARDING_NOTIFY_EMAILS` — a comma-separated env var that was never set on Vercel. Result: the alert silently no-op'd on every submission for the entire history of the feature.
- Replaced env-var lookup with a Prisma query that fetches all `ADMIN` users from the User table. Every admin is now notified automatically; recipient list stays in sync as admins are added/removed via Settings → Team. No env var to maintain.

---

## [1.14.0] — 2026-05-11

### Self-Onboarding Workflow — auto-Welcome on approval + email codes

#### Added
- **Onboarding Welcome Email (O4) now fires automatically when admin clicks "Approve Profile"** — [api/students/[id]/approve-onboarding/route.ts](src/app/api/students/[id]/approve-onboarding/route.ts) flips the status as before, then calls a new shared helper `sendOnboardingWelcomeEmail(studentId)` that renders the fee structure PDF and sends the email with all resource links. Idempotent: skipped if `onboardingEmailSentAt` was already set by an earlier admin-wizard send.
- **Workflow codes (O1 / O2 / O3 / O4) on email cards** under Settings → Emails — the four emails that make up the self-onboarding path now carry visible codes matching the workflow table. New `code` field on `EmailConfig`. Easier to map "the email in setting X" to "step Y in the workflow doc".
- New shared helper [src/lib/welcome-email.ts](src/lib/welcome-email.ts) — used by both `send-onboarding` (admin wizard manual fire) and `approve-onboarding` (auto-fire on approval). Eliminates duplication of PDF rendering + recipient logic.

#### Changed
- [api/students/[id]/send-onboarding/route.ts](src/app/api/students/[id]/send-onboarding/route.ts) — refactored to thin wrapper around the new helper.

#### Self-Onboarding Workflow (the canonical email order)
| Code | Email | Trigger | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| O1 | Enrolment Confirmation | Auto | On `Confirm Enrolment` (₹50K paid) |
| O2 | Self-Onboarding Link | Manual or bulk | Admin clicks `Send Onboard Link` |
| O3 | Onboarding Submitted Alert (internal) | Auto | Student submits self-onboard form |
| O4 | Onboarding Welcome Email | **Auto** (new) | Admin clicks `Approve Profile` |

## [1.13.2] — 2026-05-11

### UX polish on merge tag references

#### Changed
- **Emails tab — merge tag panel is now compact and collapsible.** Replaced the multi-row grid of buttons + descriptions with a single collapsible row of inline pills grouped by category (Student / Fees / Windows / Global). Click to expand. Descriptions are available on hover via `title`. Saves significant vertical space at the top of the page.
- **Resource Links — removed the "Advanced" toggle.** The merge-tag key is auto-derived from the Label exclusively; no manual editing. Keeps the row simple — one Label + one URL + one auto-generated tag chip.
- **Reminders tab — merge tags surface once at the top, not under each card.** Replaced the per-card chip rows with a single collapsible MergeTagPanel above the reminder cards, mirroring the Emails tab pattern. Two rows inside: Reminder-specific tags and Global tags.

---

## [1.13.1] — 2026-05-11

### Reminders tab — surface global merge tags

#### Changed
- The Reminders tab ([reminders-tab.tsx](src/components/settings/reminders-tab.tsx)) now shows the same global merge tags as the Emails tab next to each reminder body editor. Two rows of click-to-copy chips:
  - **This reminder:** `{{studentName}}`, `{{installmentLabel}}`, `{{amount}}`, `{{dueDate}}`
  - **Global (any email):** `{{bankDetails}}`, `{{cashFreeLink}}`, plus every dynamic resource-link tag

Global substitution already worked server-side in v1.13.0 — this is purely a UX surfacing of the available tags.

---

## [1.13.0] — 2026-05-11

### Global merge tags, Cash Free Link, dynamic Resource Links

#### Added
- **Global merge tags work in every email body** — admins can drop `{{bankDetails}}`, `{{cashFreeLink}}`, or any resource-link tag into any admin-edited email template (offer, fee reminders, enrolment confirmation, onboarding, self-onboarding link). Substitution happens server-side at send time, before the `\n → <br/>` HTML conversion, so multi-line bank details render correctly.
- **Cash Free Link** section under Settings → Emails — new `CASH_FREE_LINK` SystemSetting; available as `{{cashFreeLink}}` in any email body.
- **Dynamic Resource Links** — replaces the 3 hardcoded URL fields (Handbook / Welcome Kit / Year 1) with an add-as-many-as-you-want list. Each row has a Label, URL, and an auto-derived merge tag key (e.g. `{{handbookUrl}}`). New `RESOURCE_LINKS_JSON` SystemSetting stores the list. Existing values seed from the 3 legacy URL keys on first view (user must click Save to persist as JSON). The Onboarding Welcome Email continues to auto-render all resource links as a bullet list.
- **Merge Tag Reference panel** at the top of Settings → Emails — categorised list of every merge tag (Student / Program & Batch / Financial / Offer-window / System / Resource Links). Click any tag to copy.
- New helpers in [src/lib/mail.ts](src/lib/mail.ts):
  - `getResourceLinks()` — parses `RESOURCE_LINKS_JSON` into typed entries.
  - `getGlobalMergeTags()` — fetches all global tag values in one query.
  - `applyGlobalMergeTags(text, tags)` — substitutes only known global tags; leaves per-email tags untouched.

#### Changed
- `OnboardingEmailPayload` — replaces `handbookUrl`, `welcomeKitUrl`, `year1Url` with a single `resourceLinks: { label, url }[]` array.
- [api/students/[id]/send-onboarding/route.ts](src/app/api/students/[id]/send-onboarding/route.ts) — reads from `getResourceLinks()` instead of the 3 legacy `ONBOARDING_*_URL` keys.

#### Notes
- The 3 legacy URL settings (`ONBOARDING_HANDBOOK_URL`, `ONBOARDING_WELCOME_KIT_URL`, `ONBOARDING_YEAR1_URL`) remain readable for seeding purposes but are no longer written by the UI. Once an admin saves the new Resource Links list, those keys become inert.

---

## [1.12.1] — 2026-05-11

### Onboarding: Parent 1 + Parent 2 email now required

#### Changed
- Added `parent1Email` and `parent2Email` to the shared required-fields rule used by:
  - [self-onboard-form.tsx](src/components/onboarding/self-onboard-form.tsx) — `*` marker on email fields, `validateBeforeSubmit()` blocks submit.
  - [onboard-wizard.tsx](src/components/students/onboard-wizard.tsx) — `*` marker on Parent 1/2 email inputs, `validateProfile()` blocks Step 1 → 2.
  - [api/onboard/[token]/route.ts](src/app/api/onboard/[token]/route.ts) — server `findMissing()` rejects submit (400) if either email is blank.
  - [api/students/[id]/complete-onboarding/route.ts](src/app/api/students/[id]/complete-onboarding/route.ts) — same gate before flipping student to ACTIVE.

#### Note
Submissions made before this change (e.g. Arnee Parmar, Madhur Kalantri) may have empty parent emails. The Approve flow does not validate these fields, so existing submissions can still be approved as-is — or reset to `LINK_SENT` to force a re-fill.

---

## [1.12.0] — 2026-05-07

### Onboarding link no longer requires login + self-registration blocked

#### Fixed (security + UX)
- **Public access for `/onboard/[token]` and `/api/onboard/[token]/*`** — [src/proxy.ts](src/proxy.ts) was redirecting these to `/login`. The token in the URL is the auth (SHA-256 hash + 14-day expiry checked in the route handlers); no session needed. Students now land directly on the form without any login redirect.
- **Self-registration via magic link is now blocked** — [src/auth.ts](src/auth.ts) gains a `signIn` callback that rejects any email not already in the User table. Without this gate, `PrismaAdapter` was auto-creating User rows with default role `STAFF` for any email that submitted the login form. Net effect: only emails added via Settings → Team can sign in; strangers (and students who tried logging in via redirected onboarding links) cannot.

#### Added
- **Approve button visible for ACTIVE students too** — the wrapper that renders [SendOnboardingLinkButton](src/components/students/send-onboarding-link-button.tsx) on the student profile was gated on `student.status === "ONBOARDING"`. Now also shows for `ACTIVE` (so admins can approve self-onboard submissions from existing students who got bulk-sent links). Hidden once `selfOnboardingStatus === "APPROVED"`.
- **Onboarding form pre-fills firstName / lastName** — when a legacy student has `name` set but `firstName` / `lastName` are null, `/onboard/[token]` now splits the full name on the first space as a sensible default. The student can still correct it before submitting.

#### Behaviour confirmed (no code change needed)
- Re-submission after approval is already blocked — [api/onboard/[token]/route.ts](src/app/api/onboard/[token]/route.ts) returns 409 if `selfOnboardingStatus === "APPROVED"`, and the form goes read-only in that state.
- Existing onboarding tokens remain valid; no re-issue needed.

---

## [1.11.0] — 2026-05-07

### Onboarding: stricter required fields

#### Changed
- **Self-onboard form, admin onboard wizard, and the two onboarding APIs** now enforce a common required-fields rule before submission / completion:
  - Parent / Guardian 1 — Name + Phone (was Name only)
  - Parent / Guardian 2 — Name + Phone (was entirely optional)
  - Documents — **Student Photo**, **Aadhar Card**, **12th Marksheet** (was optional in self-onboard; Aadhar / 12th already required in admin wizard, Student Photo is new).
- "(optional)" label removed from Parent 2 sections in both flows.
- Required documents now show a `*` indicator and a red "Required" hint when not yet uploaded.
- The Step 4 review page in self-onboard shows "Required — missing" pills for unsubmitted required docs.

#### Validation paths
- **[self-onboard-form.tsx](src/components/onboarding/self-onboard-form.tsx)** — `validateBeforeSubmit()` runs before the PATCH submit; missing items listed in the error.
- **[onboard-wizard.tsx](src/components/students/onboard-wizard.tsx)** — `validateProfile()` blocks Step 1 → Step 2; document check blocks Step 2 → Step 3.
- **[api/onboard/[token]/route.ts](src/app/api/onboard/[token]/route.ts)** — `findMissing()` runs on submit; rejects with 400 + missing list.
- **[api/students/[id]/complete-onboarding/route.ts](src/app/api/students/[id]/complete-onboarding/route.ts)** — same validator; rejects 400 if rules unmet.

10th Marksheet remains required only in the admin wizard (existing behaviour); not added to the universal validator since the owner's request listed only 12th.

---

## [1.10.1] — 2026-05-07

### Dashboard outstanding excludes WITHDRAWN students + 2023 batch

#### Fixed
- **Overdue and Due-This-Month dashboard cards** — both queries in [src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx](src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx) now filter out installments belonging to `WITHDRAWN` students. Previously a withdrawn student's lapsed installments still rolled into the dashboard's "outstanding" totals; now they don't.
- **Hardcoded 2023-batch exclusion** — same two queries also filter `batch.year >= 2024`, so the LE2023 batch is invisible to dashboard outstanding totals. This is a one-off owner request; a comment in the route explains it. Remove the `batch.year` clause to revert.

#### Data
- Bulk-marked **9 LE2024 students as WITHDRAWN** (LE2024001–LE2024009). LE2024010 Taher Nasikwala and LE2024011 Zuveriya Zaheer Sayyed remain ACTIVE. Each change recorded as a `StudentAuditLog` entry with reason. Script: [scratch/mark-2024-withdrawn.ts](scratch/mark-2024-withdrawn.ts).

---

## [1.10.0] — 2026-05-07

### Team Management, Email CC, and Student Status Editing

#### Added
- **Inline name edit on team members** — admins can click a team member's name in [team-tab.tsx](src/components/settings/team-tab.tsx) to edit it inline. Pencil icon on hover, Enter to save, Esc to cancel. New `updateUserName` server action in [team.ts](src/app/actions/team.ts).
- **CC team members on outgoing emails** — new `User.ccOnEmails` boolean field (default `false`); when checked, that user is CC'd on all student/parent-facing emails (offer, offer reminders, revised offer, enrolment confirmation, onboarding, self-onboarding link, fee reminders, payment receipts). New checkbox column in the Team tab, new `updateUserCcOnEmails` server action.
- **`getTeamCcEmails` + `buildCc` helpers** in [src/lib/mail.ts](src/lib/mail.ts) — fetch CC-flagged users and merge with any per-call CC list. Wired into all 8 student-facing send functions. The internal "onboarding submitted" admin alert deliberately skips this (recipients are already all admins). Magic-link login is unaffected (separate NextAuth nodemailer transport).
- **Admin can change student status** — new admin-only "Student Status" card on the edit page ([edit-student-form.tsx](src/components/students/edit-student-form.tsx)) with a dropdown for the full `StudentStatus` enum (Offered / Onboarding / Active / Alumni / Withdrawn). Pending changes show a banner pill. Status changes are recorded in the audit log via the existing `trackChange` helper. PATCH route ([api/students/[id]/route.ts](src/app/api/students/[id]/route.ts)) validates the value against the enum and gates on admin role.

#### Schema
- `User.ccOnEmails Boolean @default(false)` — new field; pushed via `prisma db push` (no migration file needed per project convention).

---

## [1.9.0] — 2026-05-06

### Outstanding/Schedule Reconciliation Fixes

The Fee Summary "Outstanding" and the Schedule tab "pending" totals were diverging for some students. Three distinct causes identified and addressed.

#### Fixed
- **Pattern A1 (CUSTOM plan validation gaps)** — when staff entered a CUSTOM installment schedule whose rows didn't sum to the net fee, the schedule pending sum diverged from the summary outstanding. Both entry points now hard-block submission until totals reconcile:
  - **Confirm Enrolment dialog**: [confirm-enrolment-dialog.tsx](src/components/students/confirm-enrolment-dialog.tsx) now refuses submit when `customTotal !== netFee + registrationFee` (was a silent amber warning).
  - **Admin Installment Editor**: [installment-editor.tsx](src/components/students/installment-editor.tsx) now refuses save when total ≠ expected (Net Fee + Registration if a year=0 row is present, else Net Fee). Save button is disabled with a tooltip; the footer shows the expected total. The `regFee` prop is now wired through from [edit-student-form.tsx](src/components/students/edit-student-form.tsx).
- **Pattern A2 (baseFee missing registration)** — two students (LE2025003 Advait Suresh Babu, LE2025005 Archit Gupta) had `StudentFinancial.baseFee` stored as `Y1+Y2+Y3` only (without the ₹50K registration fee), causing their summary outstanding to under-report by exactly that amount. Backfilled both records via [scratch/backfill-a2.ts](scratch/backfill-a2.ts) — `baseFee` and `netFee` each incremented by ₹50,000.
- **Pattern C (1–2 rupee rounding drift across all ANNUAL students with spread waivers)** — `splitWaivers` rounded `totalSpread / 3` once and applied that to every year, so `spreadY1+spreadY2+spreadY3` could be ±1–2 rupees off from the true total spread, leaving the summary and schedule disagreeing on the last rupee.

#### Changed
- **`splitWaivers`** ([src/lib/fee-calc.ts](src/lib/fee-calc.ts)) — now returns explicit `spreadY1`, `spreadY2`, `spreadY3` fields that sum **exactly** to total spread waiver. Uses floor division and absorbs the 0–2 rupee remainder into Year 1 (then Year 2). The legacy `spreadPerYear` field is kept (now equal to `floor(totalSpread / 3)`) for backwards compatibility but new code should use the per-year fields.
- **All four `splitWaivers` callers** migrated to use the per-year fields:
  - [src/app/(dashboard)/students/[id]/page.tsx](src/app/(dashboard)/students/[id]/page.tsx) — `expectedInstFee` and the schedule waiver-breakdown line.
  - [src/app/api/students/enroll/route.ts](src/app/api/students/enroll/route.ts) — direct enrol installment generation.
  - [src/app/api/students/[id]/confirm-enrolment/route.ts](src/app/api/students/[id]/confirm-enrolment/route.ts) — confirm enrolment installment generation.
  - [src/app/api/students/[id]/route.ts](src/app/api/students/[id]/route.ts) — financial-plan PATCH installment redistribution.
- **`annualInstallmentAmounts` helper** updated to take a `split` object (matching the new `splitWaivers` shape) and an optional `deductionY1` argument; previously inlined by every caller.

#### Verified
After the fixes, **36 of 40** active students now reconcile exactly between Summary outstanding and Schedule pending. The remaining **4 students** (LE2023005 Angad Singh Dheeman, LE2023010 Shardul Gupta, LE2023011 Zainab Ezzi, LE2024011 Zuveriya Zaheer Sayyed) are legacy CUSTOM-plan records whose stored `Installment.amount` rows were imported at gross program fees with no waiver/deduction propagation. The new UI guards prevent any future student from reproducing this state; the legacy records can be reconciled via a one-off data fix when convenient.

---

## [1.8.0] — 2026-04-17

### Stored Fee Letters, Students List Improvements, Audit Log Search & Email Fixes

#### Added
- **Stored fee letters** — `FeeLetterVersion` model (Vercel Blob + DB record) stores the official fee letter per student; auto-generated and saved at enrolment (both confirm-enrolment and direct-enrol paths); serves stored copy on subsequent downloads; falls back to fresh generation for older students with no stored letter
- **Fee letter version history** — every replaced letter is archived with its date, source, and who created it; visible in the Fee Letter tab with direct "View" links to Blob URLs
- **Admin fee letter upload** — admins can upload a PDF to replace the active letter; confirmation dialog warns the current letter will be archived before proceeding; Upload/Replace button is admin-only
- **Admin fee letter regenerate** — "Regenerate" button (or "Generate" when none exists) in the Fee Letter tab lets admins re-generate the letter from current financial data; amber warning dialog shown before proceeding; old letter moved to version history; `PUT /api/students/[id]/fee-letter` endpoint handles generation + save atomically; admin-only
- **Fee letter date + source display** — Fee Letter tab now shows when the active letter was created/uploaded and whether it was auto-generated or manually uploaded
- **`src/lib/fee-letter.ts`** — shared utility: `saveFeeLetterVersion()` (uploads to Blob, deactivates old versions, inserts DB record) and `getActiveFeeLetterVersion()`
- **`GET/POST/PUT /api/students/[id]/fee-letter`** — `GET` returns active letter metadata + history; `POST` (admin only) accepts a PDF upload and replaces the active letter; `PUT` (admin only) generates a fresh PDF from current data and saves it as the new active letter
- **Audit log search** — search bar queries the full DB (`OR` filter across student name, roll no, field, old/new value, reason, moderator name/email); results count shown; Clear link when query active
- **Audit log pagination** — 50 rows per page; numbered page links with ellipsis; Previous/Next; all via URL search params (`?search=…&page=…`) — no client JS required
- **Payment reminder email drafts** — proper copy written for all 3 reminder types (1 month before, 1 week before, on due date) with escalating urgency; updated in `prisma/seed-reminders.ts` with `update:` so re-running the seed applies them; merge fields: `{{studentName}}`, `{{installmentLabel}}`, `{{amount}}`, `{{dueDate}}`
- **Students list: Next Due Amt + Next Due Date columns** — replace the old Installments column; show the first unpaid installment's amount and due date; red text for overdue; PARTIAL installments show remaining balance (`amount − paidAmount`); `—` for students with no outstanding installments

#### Changed
- **`getStudents`** — installments select now includes `dueDate`, `amount`, `paidAmount` (ordered by `dueDate asc`) to power the new columns
- **`proposal/route.ts`** — checks for active `FeeLetterVersion` first and proxies the stored Blob PDF; falls back to fresh generation only when no stored letter exists; Word (`docx`) branch removed entirely
- **Fee Letter tab** — redesigned; Download PDF button hidden when no stored letter exists; Regenerate/Generate and Upload/Replace buttons are admin-only; non-admins see only Download PDF (when a letter exists)
- **Email separation** — student/parent-facing emails (offers, reminders, onboarding, confirmations) use the Hostinger SMTP account configured in Settings → Emails (`hi@letsenterprise.in`); admin login magic links use the separate Gmail account (`GMAIL_USER`); the `GMAIL_USER`/`GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` env vars are no longer used as a fallback for student emails
- **Onboarding link route** — now checks and surfaces email send failures: returns `emailSent: false` + `emailSkipReason` when SMTP is not configured; `SendOnboardingLinkButton` shows a warning toast instead of a false "Sent" success

#### Removed
- **Word document download** — "Download Word" button removed from the Fee Letter tab; `docx` import and the `format=docx` branch removed from `proposal/route.ts`

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-04-13

### Staff Roles, Settings Redesign, Email Templates & PDF Attachment Library

#### Added
- **Attachments tab** (new Settings tab between Emails and Reminders) — lists all 3 system PDFs (Offer Letter, Fee Structure, Payment Receipt); each card shows which emails it's attached to and which sections are configurable; "Preview PDF" button renders the actual PDF with placeholder student data (Ananya Sharma, Batch 2025) and embeds it inline at 700px using a browser `<iframe>` — no new tab needed
- **PDF preview routes** — `GET /api/preview/pdf/offer-letter`, `/fee-structure`, `/receipt`; render each PDF with mock data and return `Content-Type: application/pdf` for inline embedding; session-authenticated
- **T&C changelog** — saving T&Cs now appends a dated entry to `PROPOSAL_TERMS_CHANGELOG` (JSON array stored in SystemSetting, capped at 20 entries); an optional "note" field next to the Save button lets admins describe what changed; change history card shows last 8 entries below the editor
- **Enrolment Confirmation email now configurable** — new `ENROLMENT_CONFIRMATION_EMAIL_BODY` SystemSetting key; wired into `confirm-enrolment` route; `EnrolmentConfirmationEmailPayload` in `mail.ts` gains optional `bodyText`; merge fields: `{{studentName}}`, `{{programName}}`, `{{rollNo}}`, `{{onboardingExpiryDate}}`
- **Self-Onboarding Link email now configurable** — new `SELF_ONBOARDING_LINK_EMAIL_BODY` SystemSetting key; wired into `onboarding-link` route; `OnboardingLinkEmailPayload` in `mail.ts` gains optional `bodyText`; merge fields: `{{studentName}}`, `{{programName}}`, `{{onboardingExpiryDate}}`

#### Changed
- **Settings tabs renamed** — "Proposal" → "T&C's" (`?tab=tcs`); "Offers" → "Emails" (`?tab=emails`); "Attachments" inserted between Emails and Reminders
- **Emails tab redesigned** — all system emails grouped into sections (Admissions, Enrolment, Onboarding); Payments group removed (Fee Reminders managed in Reminders tab; Payment Receipt body is hardcoded); each email card is now **3-state**: collapsed (header only, showing trigger + recipients + attachment/link badges) → click to expand read-only preview of current effective body (DB override shown normally; built-in default shown in grey italic) → click Edit for editable textarea with merge-field chips, Reset to default, and Cancel; "Custom" badge appears on any card with a DB override active
- **Staff can now create offers and enrol directly** — "Create Offer" and "Enroll Directly" buttons on the Students list are now visible to all authenticated users (not just Admins); the `/students/offer/new` and `/students/new` pages were already unguarded
- **`roles.ts` descriptions updated** — Admin: manage team, settings, batches/programs, delete students, override financials, modify installments, plus all staff actions; Staff: make offers, enrol students, do onboarding, record payments, upload documents; cannot manage team/settings/batches/programs/delete/override financials

## [1.6.0] — 2026-04-13

### Student Self-Onboarding, Document Management & Onboarding Status Gate

#### Added
- **Student self-onboarding flow** — admin sends a secure tokenised link to the student; student fills their own profile (blood group, address, parents, guardian) and uploads documents via a public-facing form at `/onboard/[token]`
- **`OnboardingToken` model** — 32-byte raw token in URL, SHA-256 hash stored in DB; tokens expire after 7 days
- **`SelfOnboardingStatus` enum** — `NOT_STARTED` → `LINK_SENT` → `SUBMITTED` → `APPROVED`; tracked per student
- **Self-onboarding status badge** on student profile — shows Link Sent / Profile Submitted / Profile Approved with colour coding
- **`SendOnboardingLinkButton`** — sends the self-onboard link email; visible on ONBOARDING students; hidden once approved
- **`POST /api/onboard/[token]/submit`** — student submits profile; sets `selfOnboardingStatus = SUBMITTED`
- **`POST /api/students/[id]/approve-onboarding`** — admin approves submitted profile; sets `selfOnboardingStatus = APPROVED` and `status = ACTIVE`
- **`POST /api/students/[id]/complete-onboarding`** — new endpoint; admin manually completes onboarding via wizard; sets `status = ACTIVE` + audit log entry
- **`POST /api/students/[id]/send-onboarding-link`** — sends tokenised self-onboard link via email
- **Onboarding status gate** — confirm enrolment now sets `status = ONBOARDING` (not `ACTIVE`); student stays ONBOARDING until admin clicks Complete Onboarding or approves self-submitted profile
- **Onboard wizard: Student Photo** added to document types list (was missing entirely)
- **Onboard wizard: Complete Onboarding** button calls `/api/students/[id]/complete-onboarding` and navigates to profile; replaces previous no-op navigation; Resend Email demoted to small secondary action
- **Documents section on Edit page** — `DocumentUpload` widget now appears at the top of `/students/[id]/edit` so admins can upload/replace documents alongside editing personal details
- **Received + Pending columns** on Students list — shows total payments received (green) and amount outstanding (red) per student; sourced from the payments journal
- **Onboarding tab** on Students list — filters to students with `status = ONBOARDING`

#### Changed
- **Confirm Enrolment** — sets `status = ONBOARDING` on confirmation (was `ACTIVE`); triggers ONBOARDING → ACTIVE transition only when admin explicitly completes onboarding
- **Onboard buttons** (Onboard Student, Send Link) — shown only when `status = ONBOARDING`; hidden once student is `ACTIVE`
- **Approve Profile button** — shown on student profile when `selfOnboardingStatus = SUBMITTED`; hidden otherwise
- **ConfirmEnrolmentDialog offers** — only `EARLY_BIRD` and `ACCEPTANCE_7DAY` offer types are auto-checked by default; all other types (`FULL_PAYMENT`, `FIRST_N_REGISTRATIONS`, `REFERRAL`) start unchecked
- **ConfirmEnrolmentDialog Annual plan** — Total row added at the bottom of the Year 1/2/3 breakdown table
- **`send-onboarding` route** — now accepts both `ONBOARDING` and `ACTIVE` status (was ACTIVE only)
- **Student profile buttons** — changed to `flex-wrap` to prevent overlap when multiple action buttons are visible
- **`getStudents`** — now includes `payments: { select: { amount: true } }` for Received/Pending computation

#### Fixed
- **Vercel Blob upload error "The string did not match the expected pattern"** — root cause: blob store was Private; `access: "public"` requires a Public store. New Public blob store created and token updated. Additionally, `file.name` is sanitised before passing to `put()` — spaces and special chars replaced with hyphens, leading/trailing hyphens stripped
- **TIF file support** — `.tif` and `.tiff` added to `accept=` in all three upload surfaces: admin document panel, admin onboard wizard, and student self-onboard form; `.webp` removed for consistency

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-13

### PDF Redesign, Workflow Restructure & LE Branding

#### Added
- **Onboard workflow page** (`/students/[id]/onboard`) — 3-step journey for ACTIVE students: (1) profile completion by team member, (2) document uploads (Aadhaar, PAN, 10th/12th marksheets, signature stored on Vercel Blob), (3) send onboarding email with proposal PDF attached
- **`OnboardWizard` component** — multi-step wizard with profile fields, file upload/delete per document type, and onboarding email trigger; shown only for ACTIVE students without `onboardingEmailSentAt`
- **`POST /api/students/[id]/send-onboarding`** — generates proposal PDF, stamps `onboardingEmailSentAt`, sends email to student + parent
- **LE logo in all emails** — `EMAIL_HEADER` (logo + "Work is the Curriculum" tagline, brand-blue divider) and `EMAIL_FOOTER` (address, website, phone) injected into every outbound email template: offer, offer reminder, onboarding, fee reminder, and receipt emails

#### Changed
- **Confirm Enrolment dialog** restructured as 4-step wizard: (1) Benefits (confirm offers + scholarships, add one-off deductions), (2) Payment Plan (choose annual/semester/trimester/custom), (3) Registration Payment, (4) Review & Confirm
- **Offer workflow** — payment plan and final fee confirmation removed; now only captures offer eligibility (indicative); final fee locked at enrolment
- **PDF fee schedule** — logo header (`le-logo-light.png`, base64-embedded), "Work is the Curriculum" tagline, full address footer; `Rs.` replacing `₹` for Helvetica compatibility; grey deductions column; placeholder row when no installments exist; filename pattern `LE-{Program}-{Student}-FeeDetails.pdf`
- **Offer letter PDF** — same logo/footer treatment; `Rs.` instead of `₹`; `"use client"` directive removed (server-side only)
- **Email attachment filenames** standardised — `LE-{Program}-{Student}-OfferLetter-{Date}.pdf` and `LE-{Program}-{Student}-FeeDetails.pdf`

#### Fixed
- **`₹` rendering as `¹`** in PDFs — Helvetica built-in font lacks the rupee glyph; replaced with `Rs.` in both PDF generators
- **Template variables appearing literally in offer letter PDF** — `{{studentName}}` etc. were not substituted before passing `bodyText` to the PDF renderer; substitution now happens in the route before PDF render
- **`"use client"` in `offer-letter-generator.tsx`** causing null-prop errors in react-pdf — directive removed; file is server-side only

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-13

### Full FIFO Payment Engine, Installment Schedule Editor & UX Fixes

#### Added
- **Full FIFO engine** (`src/lib/fifo.ts`) — `computeFifo`, `computePaymentAllocation`, `syncFifoToDb`; PAID/PARTIAL status is now exclusively FIFO-derived; cron only owns time transitions (UPCOMING→DUE→OVERDUE)
- **Installment schedule editor** — collapsible panel on the Edit Student page (visible to all, editable by admin); inline rows with PAID amount locked, PARTIAL warning, add/delete; footer shows total vs netFee
- **PATCH `/api/students/[id]/installments`** — admin-only schedule editor API; guards: cannot delete PAID installments, `changeReason` required on locked records; runs `syncFifoToDb` + audit log after every save
- **Per-payment receipt page** (`/students/[id]/receipts/payments/[paymentId]`) — shows FIFO allocation table for each payment (what it contributed to which installments), payment metadata, and print button
- **Receipt links in Payments tab** — "Receipt →" stub replaced with real links to the per-payment receipt page

#### Changed
- **Pay route** — removed per-installment status update block; transaction now runs `syncFifoToDb` after creating each payment
- **Schedule tab** — removed installment-scoped "Receipt →" links; receipts now live in the Payments tab
- **Header "Record Payment" button removed** — button was redundant; payment recording is available in the Schedule tab (per-installment) and the Payments tab (general)

#### Fixed
- **`SendOfferButton` browser form validation error** — all three buttons lacked `type="button"`, defaulting to `type="submit"` and triggering Safari's native patternMismatch validation on nearby forms; all buttons now explicitly `type="button"`
- **`send-offer` route unhandled exceptions** — added top-level try-catch so unexpected errors (e.g. PDF render failures) always return a JSON error body instead of an HTML 500 page

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-13

### Fee Calculation Correctness, Schedule Tab Redesign & Form Persistence

#### Fixed
- **Outstanding amount** — was summing non-PAID `installment.amount` values, which never included manual deductions; now computed as `max(0, netFee − totalPaid)` so deductions are always reflected
- **Deductions in Schedule tab** — `expectedInstFee` for ANNUAL plans now subtracts `StudentDeduction` total from Year 1; PATCH route installment redistribution does the same so DB values stay in sync
- **Fee breakdown tooltip** on Year 1 now shows offer waiver + one-time waiver + manual deductions as a single combined reduction line
- **Admin financial plan form not pre-populating** — `registrationFeeOverride` is now loaded into the Registration Fee input when the edit form opens (was always blank before)
- **Silent baseFee reset** — edit form previously sent `baseFee = programY1+Y2+Y3` on every admin save even if year fields were untouched, which could silently reset a custom baseFee; now only sends `baseFee` when a year fee field was explicitly changed
- **`isFinancialChanged` reg fee comparison** — now compares against the stored initial override value instead of `""` so the "reason for change" prompt triggers correctly

#### Added
- **`registrationFeeOverride`** added to `Student.financial` type in `EditStudentForm` so the value flows through correctly

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-13

### Batch Management, Scholarship Spread, Student Profile & UX Polish

#### Added
- **New Batch page** (`/fee-schedule/new`) — single form to create a new batch with programs, offers, and scholarships in one step; duplicate year blocked with a 409 error
- **Program management in fee schedule editor** — admin can add and remove programs from an existing batch; new programs get a `new-` prefix and are created on save; deleting a program with enrolled students shows a descriptive error
- **Batch name field** on the New Batch form alongside Year; defaults to `"Batch {year}"` if left blank
- **Batch filter dropdown** on the Students list page — filter by batch year alongside the existing program/status filters
- **LinkedIn, Instagram, University Choice, University Status** fields on the Student model — shown in a "Social & University" card on student detail and editable in the edit form
- **Schedule tab redesign** — replaced the old card layout with a clean table: Type / Fee (with breakdown + due date) / Received / Pending / Actions; default tab on student detail
- **FIFO payment allocation** on Schedule tab — total payments walk through installments in year order (0→1→2→3); each row shows scheme-computed fee (not stale DB amount), amount received, and amount pending

#### Fixed
- **`spreadAcrossYears` on scholarships** — enroll, confirm-enrolment, and PATCH routes now correctly split scholarship waivers into spread-per-year vs one-time-year-1, matching how offers are handled
- **Fee schedule create/update APIs** now persist `spreadAcrossYears` on scholarships
- **Scholarship tab redesign** — now displayed as a table matching the offers layout; Year 1 deduction badge shown for one-time scholarships
- **Offers condition display** — fee schedule view now shows "Spread" / "Year 1 Only" badges instead of raw JSON in the Condition column
- **Schedule fees computed from live scheme** — `expectedInstFee()` computes from current offers/scholarships rather than stale `inst.amount` DB values (fixes cases where a fee edit left installment records stale)

#### Refactored
- **`src/lib/fee-calc.ts`** (new) — centralises `isSpreadCondition`, `splitWaivers` helpers; used by enroll, confirm-enrolment, PATCH route, and both client forms; eliminates 4 copies of the same waiver-split logic
- Removed dead imports (`Trash2`, `AlertTriangle`, `DeleteStudentButton`) from student detail page
- Removed unreachable `else if` branch in PATCH route
- Fixed `HistoryTab` `AuditLog.role` type to use `Role` from `@prisma/client`
- Fixed session `as any` cast in edit page — replaced with typed narrowing

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-11

### Fee Override & Spread Waiver Improvements

#### Added
- **Per-year fee overrides** in Create Offer form and Edit Student → Manage Financial Plan — separate inputs for Registration, Year 1, Year 2, Year 3 fees; amber total badge appears when any override is active
- **`spreadAcrossYears` checkbox on offers** in Fee Schedule editor — unchecked means the waiver is deducted in full from Year 1 only; stored in `Offer.conditions` JSON; label updates in real-time
- **Registration Fee row** in student Schedule tab — always visible at the top; uses the actual year=0 installment if it exists, otherwise synthesises from `financial.registrationPaid` + `registrationFeeOverride ?? program.registrationFee`
- **Registration fee override** — admin can set a per-student registration fee in the financial plan; stored as `StudentFinancial.registrationFeeOverride`; used by confirm-enrolment when creating the year=0 installment; updates year=0 installment if unpaid
- **Admin fee overrides panel** in Create Offer form — Registration + Y1/Y2/Y3 inputs wrapped in a styled "Admin Only" section consistent with the edit form

#### Fixed
- **Spread vs one-time waiver logic** in `enroll`, `confirm-enrolment`, and PATCH routes — replaced the blanket `totalWaiver / 3` with correct split: one-time offers deduct fully from Year 1, spread offers divide across 3 years; scholarships always spread
- **Fee overrides not sent to API** — Create Offer form was applying Y1/Y2/Y3 overrides only locally (preview); now correctly sends them to `create-offer` API which uses them in `baseFee` calculation
- **Waiver breakdown text** on Schedule tab — now shows implied waiver per installment (`programYearFee − instalmentAmount`) instead of hardcoded `totalWaiver / 3`, so it is accurate for mixed spread/one-time configurations
- **Hardcoded ₹50,000 registration note** in offer form fee summary replaced with the actual registration fee (override if set, else programme default)

#### Refactored
- `depositAmount` / `depositPaid` / `depositPaidDate` (dead fields from Phase 1) removed from `StudentFinancial`; replaced by `registrationFeeOverride Decimal?` with a clear, accurate name

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-10

### Phase 10: Offer → Enrol → Onboard Workflow ✅

#### Added
- **Offer-first admissions flow** — students now enter the system as `OFFERED` before enrolment; `rollNo` is nullable and assigned only after the ₹50K registration payment is confirmed
- **Create Offer page** (`/students/offer/new`) — 3-step form: candidate details → program/offers/scholarships → review & submit; creates `OFFERED` student with financial totals but no installments
- **Send Offer Email button** on student detail — sends branded offer email with offer letter PDF attached; optional fee breakdown proposal PDF; stamps `offerSentAt` / `offerExpiresAt` (7 days)
- **Offer Letter PDF** (`src/lib/offer-letter-generator.tsx`) — LE-branded formal admission letter with fee summary box and expiry notice
- **Day-3 & Day-6 automated reminders** — cron job (`/api/cron/update-statuses`) now sends configurable reminder emails at 4 days left and 1 day left within the 7-day window
- **Day-8+ offer revision** — cron auto-revokes the `ACCEPTANCE_7DAY` waiver, recalculates net fee, logs to audit trail, and sends a revised offer letter email
- **Confirm Enrolment dialog** — records ₹50K registration payment, assigns roll number, creates installment schedule, transitions student to `ACTIVE`, optionally sends onboarding email; all in a single transaction
- **Onboarding email** — sent after enrolment confirmation; attaches the full proposal PDF (now with roll number and installment schedule); body and resource links are configurable
- **Offers tab** on students list — shows all `OFFERED` students with expiry countdown badges (violet → amber → rose → "Expires today" → "Expired")
- **Pending Offers stat card** on dashboard — violet card linking to the Offers tab
- **Offers settings tab** in Settings — editable templates for all 5 automated emails (offer, letter body, reminder 1 & 2, onboarding), bank details block, and 3 onboarding resource URLs

#### Changed
- Fee schedule seed updated to match UG-MED 2026 PDF: corrected year due dates (Aug 7 / May 15 / May 15), offer amounts, and all scholarship tiers
- `REFERRAL` removed from `OfferType`; referral is now a Category B scholarship applied to the **referring** student's record
- Students list table: `rollNo` column handles null (shows `—`); payments column shows expiry countdown for `OFFERED` students instead of installment counts
- `students.ts` `generateRollNo()` counts only students with non-null `rollNo`
- All `renderToBuffer(createElement(...))` calls cast to `any` to satisfy `@react-pdf/renderer` `DocumentProps` constraint
- `tsconfig.json` excludes `scratch/` and `dump_students.ts` from TypeScript compilation

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-10

### Phase 9: Guided Student Onboarding & Audit Log ✅

#### Added
- **3-Step Enrollment Wizard** — Refactored `/students/new` into a guided stepper:
  1. **Details**: Student and guardian contact info.
  2. **Fee Plan**: Program selection, offers/scholarships, payment plans, and custom T&C overrides.
  3. **Review**: Full enrollment summary before final submission.
- **Financial Locking** — All new enrollments are now "locked" by default (`isLocked`); protects core financial commitments from accidental modification.
- **Full Audit History** — Every change to sensitive fields (Email, Contact, Base Fee, Custom Terms) is tracked in the `StudentAuditLog`.
- **History Tab** — A new tab on the student detail page showing a chronological, user-attributed log of all record mutations with "Reason for Change" transparency.
- **Admin Change Reasons** — Mandatory "Reason for Change" input in `EditStudentForm` when an admin modifies a locked record; enforced at the API level.
- **Student-Specific Terms** — Ability to override global Proposal Terms & Conditions per student during enrollment; these custom terms are automatically prioritized during PDF/DOCX generation.

#### Fixed / Improved
- **Receipt Logic** — Ensured consistent rounding in payment receipts even for partial payments.
- **Proposal API** — Optimized term fetching to prioritize `customTerms` fallback chain.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-10

### Phase 8: Polish & Deploy ✅

#### Added
- **Loading skeletons** — animated pulse skeletons on all 5 main routes (Dashboard, Students list, Student detail, Reminders, Settings) so the UI never shows a blank white screen mid-load.
- **Global error boundary** (`error.tsx`) — catches any runtime crash inside the dashboard segment and presents a clean "Something went wrong / Try Again" screen with the Vercel error digest ID for debugging.
- **Not-found page** (`not-found.tsx`) — gracefully handles invalid student IDs or removed records with a helpful "Go to Dashboard" CTA instead of a raw 404.
- **`GET /api/v1/students/[rollNo]`** external API endpoint — returns the full student record (profile, financials, installments, offers, scholarships) authenticated by `x-api-key` header, matching the same key infrastructure as the existing list and fee-schedule APIs.

#### Fixed / Improved
- **Mobile sidebar** — switched from `collapsible="icon"` to `collapsible="offcanvas"` so the sidebar opens as a full-screen drawer on phones instead of collapsing to icon-only.
- **Table horizontal scroll** — students table (and all data tables) now scroll horizontally on small viewports instead of overflowing or compressing text illegibly.
- **Responsive padding** — page content padding reduces from `p-6` on desktop to `p-4` on mobile.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-10

### Phase 7: Settings & Admin ✅

#### Added
- **Settings hub** — rebuilt `/settings` as a 4-tab control panel: Team / API Keys / Email / Proposal.
- **Team management** (`/settings?tab=team`) — view all registered users with role badges; change any user's role (ADMIN ↔ STAFF) inline via a dropdown; self-demotion blocked.
- **API key management** (`/settings?tab=api-keys`) — generate cryptographically signed keys (`le_<48 hex chars>`); key is shown exactly once at creation with a copy button; keys can be revoked; last-used timestamp displayed per key.
- **Email configuration** (`/settings?tab=email`) — SMTP Gmail address, App Password (stored in DB, not env vars), display name, From address override, and payment instructions URL; all configurable without a Vercel redeploy.
- **Dynamic SMTP in mailer** — `src/lib/mail.ts` now reads SMTP credentials from `SystemSetting` DB first, falls back to env vars for backwards compatibility.
- **Server actions** — `src/app/actions/team.ts` (role management) and `src/app/actions/api-keys.ts` (key generation/revocation), both admin-gated.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-09


### Phase 6: Proposal Letter Generation & Phase 5 Reminders Upgrade ✅

#### Added
- **Global Settings** — `SystemSetting` DB model added. A settings dashboard page created at `/settings` allowing real-time modification of system defaults like Proposal T&Cs.
- **Dynamic Fee Schedule Overhaul** — Refactored the `Fee Schedule / Edit` page to dynamically construct Offers and Scholarships from the UI rather than relying on seeded data. 
- **Automated PDF Generator** — Leveraging `@react-pdf/renderer` to dynamically generate a branded LE Proposal PDF including dynamically mapped fee and installment information.
- **Automated MS Word Generator** — Leveraging `docx` to create a Microsoft Word version of the Proposal document for ad-hoc editability locally.
- **Download UI** — Included a Proposal view within individual Student pages to quickly click and download the formats.
- **Reminders Upgrade: Clean Simple Emailing** — Modified the outbound email processor to convert heavy marketing-banner HTML templates into completely unstyled, standard Plain-Text format messaging for Reminders while quietly keeping the `<img>` tracking pixel inside to retain Read Receipt observability.
- **Reminders Upgrade: Pipeline Dashboard** — Injected a highly visual table covering the `Reminders` Dashboard detailing exactly which Students have `UPCOMING` or `PARTIAL` payments hitting within the next 30 days.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-05

### Phase 4: Payment Tracking ✅

#### Added
- **PARTIAL payment status** — new `InstallmentStatus` enum value; pay route sets PARTIAL when `paidAmount < amount`
- **Record Payment dialog** — real-time balance display and "will mark as Partial" hint when entering a partial amount
- **Payment receipt page** at `/students/[id]/receipts/[installmentId]` — printable, shows student photo, installment details, partial notice, and notes; accessible via "Receipt →" link on each paid/partial installment row
- **PrintButton** client component — triggers `window.print()`, hidden in print output
- **Print CSS** — `@media print` rule hides nav/sidebar; `.print:hidden` utility works server-side
- **Cron job** at `/api/cron/update-statuses` — daily at 03:00 UTC (Vercel Cron); transitions UPCOMING→DUE→OVERDUE with 7-day grace period; also handles PARTIAL→OVERDUE; protected by `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}`
- **Dashboard rewrite** — live stat cards (Active Students, Overdue, Due This Month, Collected This Month); overall collection rate progress bar; Overdue Payments list (top 10, with days overdue); Recent Payments panel (last 8, with PARTIAL badge)
- **Overdue tab** on Students list (`/students?tab=overdue`) — filters to students with at least one OVERDUE installment
- **PARTIAL badge** (orange) in the payments column of the student list

#### Changed
- `getStudents()` accepts `overdueOnly?: boolean` — adds `installments: { some: { status: "OVERDUE" } }` filter
- `formatInstallmentStatus()` includes PARTIAL → orange badge styles
- Student detail installment rows: `isPaid` now covers both PAID and PARTIAL statuses

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-04

### Phases 2 & 3: Fee Schedule, Enrollment, Student Profile

#### Added
- **Student edit page** at `/students/[id]/edit` — editable personal, address, parent/guardian fields; master fields (roll no, batch, program) shown read-only
- **City** as a separate field on Student model; address section moved under Parents & Guardian card
- **Expanded student profile** — split first/last name, blood group, city, address, local address, parent 1 & 2 (name/email/phone), local guardian, document uploads
- **Document uploads** via Vercel Blob — STUDENT_PHOTO, 10th/12th Marksheet, Acceptance Letter, Aadhar Card, Drivers License
- **STUDENT_PHOTO** shown as circular avatar in student detail header; initials fallback
- **Custom installment schedule** — third payment plan tab with per-installment year dropdown; auto-fills remaining amount on add/delete
- **Waiver breakdown** shown inline on Annual installment rows (₹yearFee − ₹waiver = ₹net)
- **All amounts rounded** to the nearest rupee throughout the enrollment form and detail page

#### Fixed
- `Module not found: @prisma/client/runtime/library` — removed `Decimal` import; plain numbers passed to Prisma Decimal fields
- `AUTH_URL Invalid URL` — env var must include `https://` prefix
- `Cannot find name 'isPhoto'` TypeScript build error in `document-upload.tsx`

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-04

### Phase 1: Foundation

#### Added
- **Next.js 16** project scaffold with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and shadcn/ui
- **Prisma v7** schema with 15 tables across auth, batch/program, fee schedule, student roster, financials, installments, and API keys
- **Neon PostgreSQL** integration using `@prisma/adapter-neon` (required for Prisma v7)
- **NextAuth v5** magic link authentication via Gmail SMTP (nodemailer provider)
- **Role-based access control** — ADMIN and STAFF roles enforced via Next.js proxy middleware
- **App shell** — collapsible sidebar (shadcn/ui Sidebar), top bar, responsive layout
- **Login page** — magic link email input with post-send confirmation screen
- **Dashboard page** — stat cards for Active Students, Overdue Payments, Due This Month, Paid This Month
- **Stub pages** for Students, Fee Schedule, and Settings (to be built in subsequent phases)
- **2026 batch seed data**:
  - 3 programs: Entrepreneurial Jobs (₹13.5L), Family Business (₹17.5L), Venture Builder (₹19.5L)
  - 8 offers: First 10 Registrations, 4 Early Bird tiers, Acceptance 7-Day, Full Payment, Referral
  - 11 scholarships: 7 Category A (₹15K–₹50K), 4 Category B (₹25K flat)
- **Vercel Cron stubs** for daily status updates and reminder emails (`vercel.json`)
- **External API stubs** — architecture for `/api/v1/students` and `/api/v1/fee-schedule/[year]`
- **Architecture doc** (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) — full schema, flow diagrams, page structure, API design
- **Project plan** (`PROJECT_PLAN.md`) — 8-phase build plan with task-level tracking
- **GitHub repo** — `adityajh/LE-studentroster`, connected to Vercel for auto-deploy

#### Technical decisions
- Switched from Supabase to **Neon** for PostgreSQL (avoids 2-project free tier limit on Supabase)
- Using **NextAuth v5 beta** with magic link instead of Supabase Auth
- **Prisma v7** requires adapter-based client construction — no bare `new PrismaClient()` without adapter
- `.npmrc` set to `legacy-peer-deps=true` to resolve nodemailer peer dependency conflict between `@auth/core` versions bundled by next-auth
- Next.js 16 renames `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Razorpay integration** — auto-record payments via webhook
- **Student portal** — read-only view for students to check payment status
- **WhatsApp reminders** — via WhatsApp Business API
- **Multi-year fee schedule comparison** — view fee changes across batches
- **Bulk import** — CSV upload for existing students
